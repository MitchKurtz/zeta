# Zeta
Custom Riemann Zeta Function Approximator valid for all complex values with real component greater than 0 (excluding 1).

The underlying math for this approximation can be found below.

# Generalizations
1.) As the number of steps used in the approximation increases, the accuracy of the approximation increases in a damped harmonic logarithmic fashion

2.) As the real component of the input value increases, the accuracy of the approximation increases (assuming the same number of steps used in the calculation)
